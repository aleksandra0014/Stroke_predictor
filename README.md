# Stroke predictor 
The project involves predicting whether a person is at risk of stroke or not on the basis of data. At first, I analyzed the data, prepared visualizations, and cleaned the data. Then I made some predictive models:
- MLP (own implementation) 
- Random Forest 
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost 

Since the data is unbalanced I used the SMOTE method to make the percentage of each class contain the same number of results. 
Then I created a GUI to interactively check if a person is at risk.
